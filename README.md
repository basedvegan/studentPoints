Participation Patrons

This is a React app that makes tracking students participation as easy as clicking a button!
Start by logging into your teacher portal.
Add students to your class roster.
    *Each student input generates a QR code.
    *Print the code and paste it to the students desk.(Keeping a master list at your desk can be helpful to!)
If a student is being a rock star, add points!
    *Navigate to your QR code scanner.
    *Scan the students code.
    *Input number of points desired in designated box and submmit!
Although we hope your students are always shining bright, we know they can also dull a mood from time to time
    *To subtract points, press the subtract modal! 
The points are added to the connected MongoDB database for easy storage.
